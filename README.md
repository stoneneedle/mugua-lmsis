# mugua-lmsis

## Working Example

You may find a working example of this code at TBD.

## Overview

Mugua is a Learning Management and Student Information System (LMSIS), an acronym derived from two technologies, the Learning Management System (LMS), and the Student Information System (SIS).

The name Mugua is a Chinese word meaning "papaya."

Typically these technologies have been separate and historically somewhat costly on their own. My intent is to combine them and then reduce the costs of software and server maintenance such that they would be affordable to small private schools and public ones alike, though overall the project would be less feature-rich than say Canvas (an LMS) or PowerSchool/Schoology (PowerSchool being the SIS and Schoology being its LMS).

This is the fourth project completed for the Hofstra Quickstart Web Development Bootcamp.

## Usage

A user must first log into the server, where their role is identified as either a student, teacher, or administrator. Based upon role, access to certain functions is permitted or restricted. In general, educational administrators need access more to student information such as attendance, behavior/disciplinary records, and overall grades, whereas instructors need access more to their specific course grades, course content, assignments, wiki pages, etc. Students will need the ability to view and complete assigned tasks, as well as view grades provided by the instructor of the specific course.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies are what make Mugua work:

* Django REST backend/API
* SQLite DBMS
* React frontend with MUI

## Initial Feature List

The following features ship with pre-alpha Mugua 0.1.0:

* Teacher and student roles
* Login system, with different privileges/access for teachers/students
* Assignments view
* Pages view
* Quizzes view
* Modules view
* Grades view

## Ideas for Future Improvement

In the future, more 

1. Administrator role
1. Progress Report Generator view
1. Tuition view
1. Official School Newsletter view

## User Stories

As a student, I want to have one easy place to access homework, so I can complete assignments regardless of current location and get the best education possible.

As a teacher, I want to have a single place to grade assignments, track discipline, and assess student progress, so that I can provide the most consistent learning experience possible.

As an educational administrator, I want to have a single place to make students and teachers accountable for progress, track student grades and discipline, and respond to the needs of all stakeholders in our institution, so that I can foster the most equitable educational environment possible.
